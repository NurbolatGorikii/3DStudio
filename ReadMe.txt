The concept of 3D Studio

Our team members:

Faizulla Aibek

Baybek Almas

Gorikii Nurbolat 

The main idea of this concept is to create the first digital film studio in Kazakhstan ever.

While creating this concept, we did some visualization on this building and did great work with our team.

This building has six main rooms:

- Motion capture room

- 3D modelling room

- Render room

- 3D printing room

- Soundcheck room

- Lounge room 

Thus, we divided our work into three pieces.

First step: Room making.

Aibek: Motion capture room, Soundcheck room, additionally Work table (table, monitor, keyboard, office chair, and etc)

Almas: Lounge room, 3D modelling room

Nurbolat: 3D printing room, Render room

Second step: Combining and animation (last steps) 

Aibek: Lightning

Almas: Animation

Nurbolat: Combining rooms and render
